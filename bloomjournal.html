        <h1 class="main-title">Bloom Journal - A Modern Take on Personal Growth</h1>
        <h1 class="text">In today’s fast-paced world, managing mental health can feel overwhelming. Journaling is a proven method 
            to help people process their thoughts, track their emotions, and find clarity. It’s simple, personal, and effective
            — offering a space to reflect without judgment.<br><br>

            Motivated by the transformative potential of journaling and the possibilities of artificial intelligence, I 
            developed Bloom Journal—an AI-powered digital journal designed to enhance the traditional journaling experience 
            with modern insights. Key features include:<br><br>
        </h1>
        <h1 class="second-title">Seamless Entry Management</h1>
        <h1 class="text">
            With a user-friendly dashboard screen, journal entries can be easily viewed, created, and deleted. The backend, built with 
            Flask, handles these operations efficiently, ensuring smooth and reliable performance.<br><br>

            All journal entries and user data are stored securely in a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS. The database is designed to 
            prioritize data integrity and privacy, ensuring users feel confident that their personal thoughts are protected.<br><br>

        <h1 class="second-title">Sentiment Analysis in Real Time</h1>
        <h1 class="text">
            As users write, Bloom Journal analyzes the emotional tone of their entries. This gives immediate feedback on mood 
            trends, helping users recognize patterns and shifts in their mental state.<br><br>

        <h1 class="second-title">Weekly Summaries and Trends</h1>
        <h1 class="text">
            At the end of each week, Bloom Journal synthesizes recurring themes and significant events, offering a high-level overview 
            of your personal journey. In the insights screen, users may view their current average mood score, their journaling streak,
            and a graph of their mood score over time. Additionally, Bloom Journal generates a custom list of common themes identified
            throughout the week, along with a detailed summary of important events. <br><br>
